        <h1> All About Kayla Carleton</h1>
        <p>Because I wanted to play field hockey in college, I wanted to pick a school that had great academics and athletics. I really like the alumni network and how helpful it is for the future once I graduate.When I graduate, I want to work in the tech industry. It seems like an interesting industry and I want to be apart of the new technological advancements happening everyday.</p>
        <p>My favorite sport to watch would be basketball specifically the <b>Boston Celtics</b> </p>
